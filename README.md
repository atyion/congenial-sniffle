# 🐦 **Twitter Clone. Twitter Wannabe for friends** 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **The Twitter Clone**, where the tweets are free, the posts are endless, and the birds are... well, pretty sneaky. 😏

This is a full-stack Twitter clone built with an **Express** backend, **React** frontend, and a database powered by **MongoDB**. No extra fluff, no flashy tailwinds (though I might have to use it in the future). 

---

## 🚀 Features
- **User Authentication**: Log in and tweet (I know, crazy).
- **Post Tweets**: Share your random thoughts like a pro (or maybe just like the rest of us).
- **Feed**: Scroll through all the nonsense from people.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Express, Node.js, MongoDB (A perfect storm of power and efficiency)
- **Frontend**: React & JavaScript (We don’t like slow apps, do you?)
- **Authentication**: Cookies. I love cookies. 🍪

   ```

## 🎯 What’s Coming Next?

- **DMs**: Because who doesn’t want to slide into someone's DMs through a Twitter clone?
- **Retweets**: Because apparently, some people like doing that more than coming up with their own ideas.
- **Follows**: I mean, it's not a good clone if you can't follow people
- **Searching stuff**: Why not? Searching tweets and accounts
- **Editing your profile**: The backend is ready, now it's time to do the frontend!
- **Profile image**: Yep, I just use the default one yet!
- **I'll try to make the interface decent**: No promises
- **Much more**: I can't even count how many things I need to finish
